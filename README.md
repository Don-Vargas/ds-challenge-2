# ML Modeling Challenge B
Data Science Assessment

## Challenge
You are presented with a binary classification problem related to NBA player performance. Your task is to build, train, and evaluate a model capable of predicting whether a player will perform Above Average (1) or Below Average (0) in a given game based on historical game statistics.

The assessment consists of:
• A training dataset containing 9,000 samples.
• A blind test dataset containing 1,000 samples.
